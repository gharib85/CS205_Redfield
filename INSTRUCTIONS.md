MAIN COMPONENTS/DELIVERABLES
----------------------------

1. Python_FirstSteps ... Our first implementation of the Redfield code. Was able to identify bottlenecks and confirm problem scaling.

2. ComplexOperations ... Various matrix operations written in C for optimizing and testing. Copied parts of these operations into final Redfield code.

3. RedfieldPropagation_OpenACC ... Our main/final Redfield code. Please follow the steps below to test the code. 

4. MatrixMultiply_OpenMP ... Advanced feature: Matrix-matrix multiplication implemented using OpenMP to optimize the bottleneck portion of the Redfield code ("Lindblad term" from README.md).
