OpenCL code for matrix addition.
--------------------------------

author: hannahsim

Source code: main.c (kernel inside code but can technically use an external .cl file)

Executable: matAdd

Assumptions:
- All matrices square (A,B,C in A+B=C)
- For now, assumed all matrices real ... but need to consider complex case.
