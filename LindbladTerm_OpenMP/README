Lindblad Iteration using OpenMP
-------------------------------

After investigating a single matrix-matrix multiplication using OpenMP, we tried to implement a single computation of the "Lindblad term" (referenced/defined in the main markdown). This portion of the Redfield equation is implemented in liouville_redfield.c in both subdirectories (for serial and OpenMP implementations). 


Instructions
------------

Compiler used: icc
On Odyssey load module: intel/15.0.0-fasrc01


For serial:
	icc *.c -lblas -llapack -lm -lrt

For OpenMP:
	icc *.c -lblas -llapack -lm -lrt -openmp

Then, run and time code via:
	time ./a.out
