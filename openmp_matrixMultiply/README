Matrix-matrix multiplication using blocking and multithreading via OpenMP


Contains the following subdirectories:
- serial	... serial matrix-matrix multiplication (naive 3-loop)
- openmp        ... parallel matrix-matrix multiplication (blocking and multithreading)

Each subdirectory contains:
- a.out 	... executable
- main.c	... main routine

Compile serial version with:
	icc *.c

(after loading module: module load intel/15.0.0-fasrc01 )


Compile OpenMP parallel version with:
	icc *.c -openmp

Then run and time with: 
	time ./a.out
