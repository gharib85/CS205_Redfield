Matrix-matrix multiplication using blocking and multithreading via OpenMP


Contains the following subdirectories:
- serial	... serial matrix-matrix multiplication (naive 3-loop)
- openmp        ... parallel matrix-matrix multiplication (blocking and multithreading)

Each subdirectory contains:
- a.out 	... executable
- main.c	... main routine

Compile serial version with:
	icc *.c

(after loading module: module load intel/15.0.0-fasrc01 )


Compile OpenMP parallel version with:
	icc *.c -openmp

** If running an interactive job, one can set the number of threads via: export OMP_NUM_THREADS=[INSERT NUMBER OF THREADS]. Alternatively, one may include the following lines in the submission (.sh) file: 

```
# Run program
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
srun -c $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK ./a.out > 128_1thread.tx
```

Then run and time with: 
	time ./a.out
