C scripts in this directory perform various matrix operations on complex-valued and real-valued matrices.

These were implemented to test individual operation to ensure efficiency and accuracy for the main Redfield code.

Two different methods were implemented: 
- naive matrix multiplication using complex.h
- naive matrix mutliplication with complex matrices broken up into real and imaginary parts (Term "complexified" was used for this separation process.)

The latter implementation is faster for large (N ~> 240) matrices.
