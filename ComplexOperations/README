C scripts in this directory perform serial matrix mutliplications on complex
valued matrices

Two different methods were implemented: 
- naive matrix multiplication using comlex.h in mat_mul_complex.c
- naive matrix mutliplication with complex matrices broken up into real and 
  imaginary part in mat_mul_complexified.c

 The latter implementation is faster for large (N ~> 240) matrices (plots will follow)
